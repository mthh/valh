***Interface Between R and the OpenStreetMap-Based Routing Service
[Valhalla](http://valhalla.github.io/)***

## Description

[Valhalla](http://valhalla.github.io/) is a routing service that is based on OpenStreetMap data.
This package provides an interface to the Valhalla API from R.
It allows you to query the Valhalla API for routes, isochrones, time-distance matrices, nearest point on the road network, and elevation data.

This package relies on the usage of a running Valhalla service (tested with v3.4.x-3.5.x of Valhalla).

## Features

- `vl_route()`: Get route between locations.
- `vl_matrix()`: Get travel time matrices between points.
- `vl_locate()`: Get the nearest point on the road network.
- `vl_elevation()`: Get elevation data at given location(s).
- `vl_isochrone()`: Get isochrone polygons.
- `vl_optimized_route()`: Get optimized route between locations.
- `vl_status()`: Get information on Valhalla service.

## Installation

```R
# install.packages("remotes")
