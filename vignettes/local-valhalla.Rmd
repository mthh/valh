## Introduction

Valhalla is an open-source routing engine that uses OpenStreetMap data to provide
routing services. A demo server that is open to the public and includes a full planet
graph is available at [https://valhalla.openstreetmap.de](https://valhalla.openstreetmap.de).

However, the valhalla documentation states that *"usage of the demo server follows the usual
fair-usage policy as OSRM & Nominatim demo servers"*
([source](https://valhalla.github.io/valhalla/#demo-server)) and that this is enforced by
a rate limit of "*1 call/user/sec and 100 calls/sec total*"
([source](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/discussions/3373#discussioncomment-1644713)).

This means that if you want to use Valhalla for a large number of requests, you will need to
install it locally or on your own server.

This vignette explains how to install Valhalla locally using Docker.

## Prerequisites

To follow this vignette, you need to have Docker installed and running on your machine or server
as well as a terminal to run the commands.
The commands in this vignette should work on any operating system (Linux, MacOS, Windows).

The installation of Docker is not covered here, but you can find the instructions on the official
Docker website:
[https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).
To ensure that Docker is installed correctly, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

If Docker is installed correctly you should see a message saying "Hello from Docker!".

## Valhalla installation

Several Docker images are available,
[the official one provided by Valhalla](https://github.com/orgs/valhalla/packages)
and [one maintained by the community](https://github.com/nilsnolde/docker-valhalla).

The community-maintained image features many additional options, particularly useful for
customizing the Valhalla instance to be created. This is the one we'll be using.

### Downloading an OSM extract

The first thing you need is an OpenStreetMap file, in osm.pbf format, of the region you want
to work on.

You can download an extract of the OSM data from [Geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/)
or [BBBike](https://extract.bbbike.org/).
Planet files are available on [https://planet.openstreetmap.org/](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/),
but they are very large and not recommended for local use (as they would require a lot of memory).

Create a folder in which to store this file, here we'll call it “routing-valhalla” (use
`mkdir routing-valhalla` in your terminal to create it).
Then, download the OSM extract and move it to this folder.

### Running the Docker container

To run the Docker container, you need to run the following command in your terminal (you need
to be in the parent folder of the `routing-valhalla` folder you created earlier, or else you
will need to adapt the path to the folder):

```bash
docker run -t --name valhalla_server \
    -e build_elevation=True \
    -p 8002:8002 \
    -v $PWD/routing-valhalla:/custom_files \
    ghcr.io/nilsnolde/docker-valhalla/valhalla:latest
```

Here we are using:

- the `-t` option to run the container in interactive mode,
- the `--name` option to name the container `valhalla_server`,
- the `-p` option to publish the container's port 8002 to the host's port 8002,
- the `-v` option to mount the folder we created earlier (`routing-valhalla`)
  to the `/custom_files` folder in the container,
- `ghcr.io/nilsnolde/docker-valhalla/valhalla:latest` image to run the container.

and more importantly,

- the `-e` option to set the environment variable `build_elevation` to `True`,
  which will build the elevation data for the region.

Other useful options are listed on the
[image repository](https://github.com/nilsnolde/docker-valhalla?tab=readme-ov-file#environment-variables).

These include :
- `build_elevation` to download and build elevation data (default: `False`), this is particularly
  useful for bicycle and pedestrian routing,
- `build_admins` to build administrative boundaries (default: `False`), this is useful for applying
  border-crossing penalties,
- `build_time_zones` to build timezone data (default: `False`), this is useful for time-dependent
  routing.

Once the graph is built, you should see a message like this:

```bash
INFO: Found config file. Starting valhalla service!
```

Note that this message is often followed by a several other messages, such as:

```bash
[INFO] Tile extract successfully loaded with tile count: 166
[WARN] (stat): /custom_files/traffic.tar No such file or directory
[WARN] Traffic tile extract could not be loaded
```

This is normal, as we did not provide traffic data to the container (and as traffic data are
loaded when the server is started).

You can now access the Valhalla API at `http://localhost:8002/` (go to http://localhost:8002/status
in your browser to check that the server is running).

### Stopping/restarting the container

To stop the container, you can first kill the process running in the terminal (using `Ctrl+C`), or
you can run the following command in another terminal:

```bash
docker stop valhalla_server
```

To restart the container, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker start valhalla_server
```

This time the server will start instantly, as the graph has already been built, and the container
will run in the background (in detached mode). If needed you can check the logs of the container with:

```bash
docker logs valhalla_server
```

## Using Valhalla with R

To use your custom Valhalla instance with R and the `valh` package, you just need to change the
`valh.server` option to the url of your server or your machine :

```r
options(valh.server = "http://localhost:8002/")
```

You can also set this option in your `.Rprofile` file to make it permanent.

You're now ready to use `valh` with your own Valhalla installation!
